Project Euler is a website that gives Mathematical Problem which you can solve by simple Programming

Leonhard Euler (1707 – 1783) (/ˈɔɪlər/ OY-lər; German pronunciation: [ˈɔʏlɐ] ( listen), local pronunciation: [ˈɔɪlr̩] ( listen)) was a pioneering Swiss mathematician and physicist. He made important discoveries in fields as diverse as infinitesimal calculus and graph theory. He also introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation, particularly for mathematical analysis, such as the notion of a mathematical function. He is also renowned for his work in mechanics, fluid dynamics, optics, astronomy, and music theory.

Euler is considered to be the preeminent mathematician of the 18th century and one of the greatest mathematicians to have ever lived. He is also one of the most prolific mathematicians; his collected works fill 60 to 80 quarto volumes.He spent most of his adult life in St. Petersburg, Russia, and in Berlin, then the capital of Prussia.



Example:
Multiples of 3 and 5
Problem 1


If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.



Maximum path sum I
Problem 18


By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

3
7 4
2 4 6
8 5 9 3

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:

75
 95 64
 17 47 82
 18 35 87 10
 20 04 82 47 65
 19 01 23 75 03 34
 88 02 77 73 07 63 67
 99 65 04 28 06 16 70 92
 41 41 26 56 83 40 80 70 33
 41 48 72 33 47 32 37 16 94 29
 53 71 44 65 25 43 91 52 97 51 14
 70 11 33 28 77 73 17 78 39 68 17 57
 91 71 52 38 17 14 91 43 58 50 27 29 48
 63 66 04 68 89 53 67 30 73 16 69 87 40 31
 04 62 98 27 23 09 70 98 73 93 38 53 60 04 23

NOTE: As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route. However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o)
